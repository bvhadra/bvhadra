<h2>As a versatile Web Developer and Designer, I excel in both front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) and back-end technologies (Node.js, C#, PHP, WordPress). My expertise includes creating compelling web designs and developing functional applications. I have developed many professional websites.</h2>

<h3>My GitHub portfolio showcases projects like the 'CarbonZero App' (a React sustainability app), custom WordPress themes, a Recipe Search App, a Trivia Quiz App, and a Task Manager App. I combine technical skills with business insight to deliver effective solutions.

I am committed to continuous learning and actively participate in tech events and networking groups to stay updated. With experience in collaborative and freelance projects, I thrive in team environments and work independently on complex projects.

I approach every project with passion and perseverance, ensuring clear communication and high-quality results. Please view my projects and portfolio for examples of my skills and professional expertise.</h3>
